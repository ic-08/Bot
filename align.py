#Isaac, you request this... Also, I didn't paste all of your code in here, and I also renamed some variables for my own sake
#So just copy and paste this code, and then re-adjust your code... haha... - James

#Also, Isaac, I'm planning on debugging this with you together. If it works on the first try... Wow, because I did no debugging, all of this was done in my head, and also my head is hurting üëç

## Also, Isaac, thanks for the code you put in the testing.py, helped me alot üòâ ##
