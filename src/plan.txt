Ok so this is the plan:

Once I receive $timer <seconds>, I store the timer, the number of seconds, and the date inside a dict,
Which in itself is inside a list.
Use schedule module to schedule them

In message_listener, use message.created_at to get time of creation

And then add the time, and then you're done!
